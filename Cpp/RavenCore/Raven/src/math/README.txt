Raven :: MATH :: structures
-----------------------------
* Convention break 
  The structures and classes will be named to match the convention in the GLSL,
  where vectors are called vec1, vec2 etc. and matrices mat3, mat4 etc.
  Normaly these structures and classes should be named with an upper case first
  letter, not lower case.
